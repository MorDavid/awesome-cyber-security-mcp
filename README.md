## 🚀 What is MCP?

**Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is like a universal translator between AI and your tools.  
It allows AI models to safely communicate with and control your local security tools, APIs, and databases.

🔄 No more context switching.  
🤖 Just pure AI-powered automation for your entire security workflow.
