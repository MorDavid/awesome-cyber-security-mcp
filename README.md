# Cyber Security Model Context Protocol (MCP) [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)
Supercharge your security tools with AI! This is your ultimate guide to MCP-powered security tools that transform how you hack, defend, and analyze threats. Built for security pros who want to unleash AI's full potential in their security stack.

## What is MCP?
Think of MCP as a universal translator between AI and your tools. It's an open protocol that lets AI models safely talk to and control your local security tools, databases, and APIs. No more context switching - just pure AI-powered automation for your security workflow.
